# My-First-Project
This is the first thing i created after learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JS.
I tried recreating a web page- https://gomycode.com/NG-EN/store from the website "gomycode.com" using my own code. 
The tools employed in recreating this page are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript .
