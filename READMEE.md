### Description
Create a contact form component that handles user inputs and form submissions for customer inquiries. This form should allow customers to submit their questions or feedback, which will then be sent to the appropriate contact point.

### Requirements
- **Form Fields:** Include fields for the customer's name, email address, subject, and message.
- **Validation:** Ensure all fields are properly validated. Name and email should not be empty, email should be in a valid format, and message should not be empty.
- **Form Submission:** Handle form submission, ensuring the data is correctly captured and sent to the designated endpoint.
- **Response Handling:** Provide feedback to the user upon successful form submission or display error messages if submission fails.
- **Styling:** The form should be styled to match the overall design of the website and be fully responsive.
